I got the windows of my car tinted recently.  Why would a statistician approaching middle age do this?  It could be that I read about the low UV protection offered by the tempered glass on side windows and believe the skin damage while driving is a pernicious risk for skin cancer.  It could also be that I was so blown away by Bow Wow and Lucas Black's performances in *Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift* that I've decided tinted windows are for me.

If you too decide to get tinted windows, you will have an important decision to make: how dark?  Within a class of tint materials (ceramic, dyed, etc.) a lower visible light transmission (VLT) rating means more light blocked.  This includes visible, infrared and UV radiation, so a low VLT seems preferable if you like a chilly car and undamaged skin. As long as you're not considering limo tint, the main downside of low VLT treatment is that if you go too dark, you may be in violation of your justdiction's laws.   US residents will be brought to a familiar conclusion: this choice comes down to navigating our quasi-fuedal, inexplicable system of state laws, and of course all of them are different.

Dumbfounded by the lack of visualizations available to answer this question, I made the following:

The data are pulled from [here](https://www.raynofilm.com/blog/automotive-window-tint-laws-by-state), and I made the simplification of taking the maximum of the rear and side numbers, since all but 6 states have the same laws for those regions of the car.

I had some hypotheses about window tints that I can think more clearly about now.  First, I figured that states with lots of sun or high temperatures would be more likely to allow low VLT tints.  There's a bit of this, the heaviest restrictions in the north on front windows. 

I also expected that state politics would come into play here.  Maybe states with a libertarian vibe would allow you to do whatever with your car.  On the other hand there's a lot of law enforcement support in conservative and libertarian states, and it would be more convenient for policing if we just made the entire car out of clear glass.

My dissertation on state window tinting laws in US will have to wait.  Just wanted to donate one graphic to the internet.
