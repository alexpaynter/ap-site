      <description>I got the windows of my car tinted recently. Why would a statistician approaching middle age do this? It could be that I read about the low UV protection offered by the tempered glass on side windows and believe the skin damage while driving is a pernicious risk for skin cancer. It could also be that I was so blown away by Bow Wow and Lucas Black&amp;rsquo;s performances in Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift that I&amp;rsquo;ve decided tinted windows are for me.</description>
