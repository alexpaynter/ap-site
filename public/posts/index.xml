      <description>I got the windows of my car tinted recently. Why would an office professional approaching middle age do such a thing? It could be that I read about the low UV protection offered by car side windows, due to the tempered glass that&amp;rsquo;s used, and I believe the skin damage incurred while driving adds up to a pernicious risk for skin cancer over time. It could also be that I was so blown away by Bow Wow and Lucas Black&amp;rsquo;s performances in Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift that I&amp;rsquo;ve decided tinted windows are the life for me.</description>
